Min Graph Coloring is the problem of assigning colors to vertices in a graph such that no adjacent vertices share the same color, while using the minimum number of colors possible. The minimum number of colors needed is called the chromatic number of the graph. Finding the exact chromatic number is NP-hard, which means it becomes computationally intractable for large graphs.
